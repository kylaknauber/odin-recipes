        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Use any combination of ripe summer fruit you can find for this fresh fruit "pizza." 
            The crust is one big sugar cookie that can be baked a day ahead and kept well wrapped 
            until you're ready to spread it with the cream-cheese topping 
            (which you can also make a day ahead). 
            The dough could double as your go-to sugar cookie recipe too--just form it into balls 
            and bake at 350 degrees F for a soft, chewy treat.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Sugar Cookie Crust</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Topping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>
                4 to 5 cups mixed fresh summer fruit, such as whole raspberries, 
                blackberries, and blueberries, quartered strawberries and sliced stone fruit.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the sugar cookie crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>
                Beat the granulated sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                Add the flour, baking powder and salt and mix on low speed until just combined. 
                Scrape the dough into a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet and press into an even layer to cover the entire bottom of the skillet. 
                (If the dough becomes too soft to work with, pop the skillet in the refrigerator to chill for 10 minutes before proceeding.) 
                Prick the dough all over with a fork, leaving a 1-inch border.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake the crust until golden and the edges are set, 22 to 24 minutes. 
                Let cool in the skillet on a wire rack, then loosen the edges of the crust with a butter knife and invert onto a platter or cutting board to unmold. 
                nvert again so the crust is right-side up. (To make ahead, let cool, then wrap well in plastic wrap and keep at room temperature.) 
            </li>
            <li>
                For the topping: Clean out the mixer bowl and add the cream cheese and butter. Beat on medium speed until light and smooth, about 1 minute. 
                Add the honey and vanilla and beat to combine. Add the confectioner's sugar and beat on low speed until just combined. 
                Increase the speed to high and beat until fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Refrigerate the topping, covered, until ready to use (stir again until smooth).
            </li>
            <li>
                To assemble the fruit pizza, spread the cream cheese topping on the crust in an even layer, leaving a border for the crust. 
                Top with the fruit in a random pattern. Dust with more confectioner's sugar if using just before serving, then cut into slices.  
            </li>
        </ol>
